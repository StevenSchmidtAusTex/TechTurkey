# Tech Turkey

Developer: Steven Schmidt

## Overview

Tech Turkey is a basic technology blogging application, allowing the user to make blog posts which are then saved and appended to the homepage, along with seeing the posts
of other users. The user can login, create, and delete their own posts but not those of others.

Creating a new blog post.


## Future Development

The current application is very basically styled, and the "like feature" currently is non-functional. In addition, I would like to add a auto-playing turkey noise when the user
changes pages.
